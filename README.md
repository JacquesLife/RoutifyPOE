app/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/           # Data layer (API, database, repositories)
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/         # Business logic and use cases
â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/   # UI screens and view models
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/            # UI components and themes
â””â”€â”€ utils/         # Utility classes and helpers
```

### Key Technologies
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit
- **Room Database**: Local data persistence
- **Retrofit**: Network API communication
- **Google Maps SDK**: Interactive maps and location services
- **Google Places API**: Place search and transit data
- **DataStore**: Secure user preferences storage
- **Navigation Compose**: Type-safe navigation
- **ViewModel & StateFlow**: Reactive state management

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or later
- Android SDK 24+ (Android 7.0)
- Google Maps API key
- Google Places API key

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/routeify.git
   cd routeify
   ```

2. **Get Google Maps API Key**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable the following APIs:
     - Maps SDK for Android
     - Places API
     - Directions API
     - Distance Matrix API
   - Create credentials (API Key)
   - Restrict the key to your app's package name and SHA-1 fingerprint

3. **Configure API Keys**
   Create a `local.properties` file in the root directory:
   ```properties
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Build and Run**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   
   Or use Android Studio:
   - Open the project in Android Studio
   - Sync the project with Gradle files
   - Run the app on an emulator or device

### Required Permissions
The app requires the following permissions (automatically granted):
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` - For precise location services
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - For approximate location services
- `INTERNET` - For API communication
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` - For network status monitoring
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - For transit alerts (Android 13+)

## ðŸ“± Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Launch the app** and create an account or sign in with Google
2. **Grant location permissions** when prompted
3. **Explore the home screen** to see recent destinations and quick access features

### Planning a Route
1. Navigate to **Google Services** â†’ **Route Planner**
2. Enter your **starting location** (or use current location)
3. Enter your **destination**
4. Select your **preferred departure time** or choose "Leave Now"
5. Choose **transport modes** (bus, train, tram, walking)
6. Review **route options** and select the best one
7. View the route on the **interactive map**

### Finding Nearby Transit
1. Go to **Google Services** â†’ **Nearby Transit**
2. The app will show **transit stops** near your current location
3. **Tap any stop** to see detailed information
4. Get **directions** to the stop or plan a route from there

### Using the Map
- **Zoom in/out** to see more or fewer transit stops
- **Tap clustered markers** to expand and see individual stops
- **Switch between day/night** map styles
- **Toggle transit lines** visibility
- **Follow route polylines** for turn-by-turn navigation
